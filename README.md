__Hi there!, How are you doing?__

__I hope you doing well :)__

# Django-Celery-Redis Integration WebApp
In this project i leverage django to make an webapp which uses Stability AI to generate text-to-image by using redis
broker and celery, the app is now scalable horizontally and performance is enhanced due to celery and redis library
.

___Note: This project is compatible with Windows along with docker.___

## Technologies used:
* Django
* Docker
* Celery
* Redis
* Stability AI

## Let's get started
### First we start with basic django configurations:

*  Creating Virtual Environment :

```python -m venv venv```

* Activating Virtual Environment :

```.\venv\Scripts\activate```

* Cloning the repo :

```git clone https://github.com/RiturajAgrahari/django-celery-assignment.git```

* Installing the requirements :

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

* Create a .env file and adding these details into it :

```
DJANGO_SECRET_KEY = "your_django_secret_key"
STABILITY_API_KEY = "your_stability_api_key"
CELERY_BROKER_REDIS_URL = "redis://redis:6379"
```

__API KEY__: https://platform.stability.ai/docs/api-reference#tag/Text-to-Image/operation/textToImage

* Now we will make migrations to initiate our sql lite db
```
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

* __Additional Note:__ Create a `media` dir in main directory

### Celery Configuration
* celery settings is configured in bottom of `settings.py` in project_dir that is `assignment`
* celery is initiated in `celery.py` in `aigeneration` app
* celery is started in django through `__init__.py` in `assignment`
* celery separate worker service is running through docker


### Docker configuration
* _here i used docker desktop for windows_
* all docker config files are already included in the repo
* Run this command to start the docker :

```docker-compose up -d --build```

### Done!
* ___The project will be on http://127.0.0.1:8001/___
* There is very little delay in updation of history/images because django-channels are not used in this project.
* As i completely focused on what i said to do, but if you want frontend (using react.ts), or if you want it be hosted
(on my linux VPS, using nginx and gunicorn), so it can be done as well. 


### Extro :
The project is fully tested and it is working completely fine, but as a developer i know what can 
be possibly happen, so i have a gentle request, if you find any mistake or if you find anything wrong in this
or if you think this is a not the best way to do that, please drop a message i would love when i get to know about 
my mistakes, because after you i will never want anyone to point the same mistake again.


### Thankyou :
Thankyou so much for watching this repo, have a nice day forever

### You can skip this:
* __This is not a production build. It will work on locally only.__
* It is only designed to do the specified task, otherwise it can be way more better than the current stage.
* Some steps can be done in different way as well, but i found this to be the best approach to accomplish the specified task.
* It is completed tested
